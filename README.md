# Swipe-project
Final project from the Udemy course "The HTML & CSS Bootcamp 2025 Edition" by Colt Steele.

Due to a year-long gap in learning, I reviewed the material covering the basics of HTML and CSS. 
It was a great refresher that helped me regain confidence and reinforce my foundational knowledge.

Key takeaways: understanding semantic HTML, proper page structure, the CSS box model, positioning, layout techniques (Flexbox and Grid), animations, and how to create responsive designs using media queries.
